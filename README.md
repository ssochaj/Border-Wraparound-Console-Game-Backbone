# Border Wraparound Console Game Backbone

Welcome to my Border Wraparound Console Game Backbone project! This project serves as the foundation for a console-based game where a player can control an object's movement within a game board with border wraparound behavior.

## Description
This C code serves as the foundation for a console-based game where a player can control an object's movement within a game board. The game board features border wraparound behavior, meaning the object moves off one edge and reappears on the opposite edge, allowing continuous gameplay within the defined boundaries. The code includes input processing, game logic, screen drawing, and variable speed levels, offering users the ability to control the game's speed.

Keep in mind that this code can be used as a starting point to build various games and simulations by adding more features and functionality.

## Features

- Player-controlled object with directional movement (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Border wraparound behavior: The object seamlessly reappears on the opposite edge when it hits the game board boundary.
- Asynchronous input processing, enabling smooth user interaction.
- Customizable game speed with different levels for an engaging gaming experience.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to create a console-based game backbone with a focus on user interaction and smooth gameplay. I've implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage the object's movement, and I've paid attention to details like input handling, screen drawing, and wraparound mechanics.
